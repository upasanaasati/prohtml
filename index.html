    <h1>Backtracking </h1>
    <p style="color:grey">Backtracking is Form of Recursion</p>
    <p style="color:grey">The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must
        choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set of options;
        just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and
        over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final state is
        a goal state; if you didn't, it isn't.</p>
    <p style="color:grey">Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some
        good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that the leaves
        are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node,
        beginning with the root, you choose one of its children
        to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf. </p>
    <p style="color:grey"> Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good
        leaf by revoking your most recent choice, and trying out the next option in that set of options.
        If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node.
        If you end
        up at the root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p>

    <p>This needs an Example.</p>
    <img src="./Image_root.png" alt="">
    <ol start="1" style="color:grey">
        <li>Starting at the Root, Your option are A and B. You choose A.</li><br>
        <li>At A, your option are C and D. You Choose C.</li><br>
        <li>C is bad.Go Back to A.</li><br>
        <li>At A, You have already tried C, and it faild. Try D.</li><br>
        <li>D is bad . Go back to A.</li><br>
        <li>At A, You have no option left to try. Go back to Root.</li><br>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li><br>
        <li>At B, your option are E and F. Try B.</li><br>
        <li>E is good. Conguratulation!</li><br>

    </ol>
    <div style="background-color: grey;">
        <p style="padding: 10px;">In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the
            possible sequences of choices we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree,
            but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual
            tree data structure, backtracking on
            it is called depth-first tree searching.)</p>

    <h2>The Backtracking algorithm</h2>
    <div style="border: solid grey">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
          boolean solve(Node n) {
            if n is a leaf node{
              if the leaf is a goal node true
              else return false
            } else {
               for each Child c of n {
                if solve(c) succeeds retturn true
               }
               return false
            }
          }
          </pre>
    </div>
    <div style="background-color: grey;">
        <p>Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to
            understanding the algorithm. If solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is,
            node n is one of the nodes on a path from the root to some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If
            solve(n) is false,
            then there is no path that includes n to any goal node.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>How does this work?</h2>
    <ul style="color:grey; padding:1em;">
        <li>if any child of n is slovale, then n is solvable.</li>
        <li>if no child of n is solvable,then n is not solvable.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="color:grey">Hence to decide whether any non-leaf n is solvable(part of a path to goal node),all you
        have to do is test whether any child of n is solvable.This is done recursively, on In the
        above code, this is done by the lines
    </p>
    <div style="border: solid grey">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
            for each child c of n{
              if solve(c)succeds,return true
            }
            return false
            </pre>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p style="color:grey">Eventually thed recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node.if the leaf node is a goal
        node,it is solvable,if the leaf node is not a goal node ,it is not
        solvable.This is our base case in the above code,this is done by the lines</p>
    <div style="border: solid grey">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
                if n is a leaf node{
                  if the leaf is a goal niode,return true
                  else return false
                }
                </pre>
    </div><br>
    <p style="color:grey">The backtracking algorithm is simple but important.You should understand it thoroghly.Another
        way of stating it is as follows:</p>

    <ul style=" padding:1em;">
        <li><b style="color:black">To search a tree</b></li>
    </ul>
    <ol start="1" style="color:grey; padding:1em;">
        <li>if the tree consists of a single leaf,test whether it is a goal node.</li>
        <li>otherwise,search the subtree until you find one containing goalnode or until you have<br>
            searched them all unsuccessfully</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Non-recursive backtracking,using a stack</h3>

    <p style="color:grey">Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm,and any recursive
        algorithm can be rewritten as a stack algorithm.in fact,that is how your recursive algorithm are translated into
        machine or assembly language.
    </p>
    <div style="border: solid grey">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        boolean solve (Node n){
          put node n on the stack;
           while the stack is not empty{
            if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf{
              if if is a goal node,return true
              else pop it off the stack
            }
            else{
              if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
                push the next untried child onto the stack
              else pop the node off the stack  
           
            }
          return false
        }
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p style="color:grey">Starting from the Root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of
        the node currently on the top of the stack,and these are onlt pushed on one child at a time;
        hence,the nodes on the stack at all times describe a validpath in the tree.
        Nodes are removed from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among their
        descrendents.Therefore,if the root node gets removed(making the stack empty),there must have been no
        goal nodes at all,and no solution to the problem.
    </p>
    <p style="color:grey">When the stack algorithm terminates successfully,the nodes on the stack form (in reverse
        order)a path
        from the root to a goal node.
    </p>
    <p style="color:grey">Similarly,when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node,the path information is embodied(in
        reverse
        order)in the sequence of recursive calls.Thus as the recursion unwinds,the path can be recovered one node
        at a time,by(for instance)printing the node at the current level,or storing it an array.
    </p>
    <p style="color:grey">Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm,modified slightly to print(in reverse order)the
        nodes
        along the successful path:</p>
    <div style="border: solid grey">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
          boolean solve (Node n){
            if n is a leaf node{
              if the leaf is a goal node{
                print n
                return true
              }
               else return false
            }else{
              for each childc of n{
                if solve(C)succeeds{
                  print n
                  return
                }
              }
              return false
            }
          } 
          </pre>
    </div>
    <h3>Keeping bachtracking simple</h3>
    <p style="color:grey">All of these version of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple,but when applied to
        a real problem they can get prettycluttered up with details.Even determining whether
        the nodes is a leaf can be complex:</p>
    <p style="color:grey">for example,if the represent a series of moves in a class endgame problem,the leavesare
        the checkmate and stalemate solution</p>
    <p style="color:grey">To keep the program clean, therefore, tests like this should be buried in methods. In a
        chess game, for example, you could test whether a node is a leaf by writing a <b style="color:black"> gameOver
            method</b>
        (or you could even call it <b style="color:black">isLeaf</b>). This method
        would encapsulate all
        the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain. </p>
    <p style="color:grey">Notice that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the
        current path, which of its children have been tried already (so we don't have to try them again).
        In the above code we made this look simple, by just saying <b style="color:black">for each child c of n.</b>In
        reality, it may be
        difficult to figure out what the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through
        them. In chess, for example, a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child
        of that node can represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these
        children, and how do you keep track of which ones you've already examined? </p>
    <p style="color:grey">The most straightforward way to keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as
        follows:
        Upon initial entry to the node
        (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As you try each child,
        take it off the list. When the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can return
        "failure."
        This is a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of additional work. </p>
    <p style="color:grey">here is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an
        ordering on the children. If there is an ordering, and you know which child you just tried,
        you can determine which child to try next. </p>
    <p style="color:grey"> For example, you might be able to number the <b style="color:black">children 1 through
            n,</b>and try them in
        numerical order. Then, if you have just tried <b style="color:black">child k,</b> you know that you have already
        tried children 1
        through <b style="color:black">k-1,</b> and you have not yet tried children <b style="color:black">k+1</b>
        through n. Or, if you are trying to color a map with
        just four colors, you can always try <b style="color:black"> red first, then yellow, then green, then blue.</b>
        If child yellow fails,
        you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try choices in the order
        left, straight, right <b style="color:black">(or perhaps north, east, south, west).</b> </p>
    <p style="color:grey"> It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a node. <b
            style="color:black"> In the chess game example,</b> you might
        number your pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order; but in addition each
        piece may
        also have several moves, and these must also be ordered. You can probably find some way to order the children of
        a
        node. If the ordering scheme is simple enough, you should use it; but if it is too
        cumbersome, you are better off keeping a list
        of untried children.

    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Example: Tree search</h3>
    <p style="color:grey">For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an
        actual
        tree.</p>
    <p style="color:grey">A binary tree is a data structure composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node.
        Each node can reference (point to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The
        children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child. All nodes are reachable
        (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this
        is not part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not be a goal
        node, and will contain its name. The first example in this paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary
        tree. </p>

    <p style="color:grey">Here's a definition of the Binary Tree class:</p>
    <div style="border: solid grey">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        public class Binary Tree{
          BinaryTree leftChild = null;
          BinaryTree rightChild = null;
          booleanisGoalNode = false;
          String name;
          BinaryTree(String name,BinaryTree left,Tree right,booleanisGoalNOde){
            this.name = name;
            leftChild = left;
            rightChild = right;
            this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
           }
        } 
          </pre>
    </div>
    <p style="color:grey">Next we will create a TreeSearch class,and in it we will
        define a makeTree()which constructs
        the above binary tree.
    </p>
    <div style="border: solid grey">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        static BinaryTree makeTree(){
         BinaryTree root,a,b,c,d,e,f;
         c = new BinaryTree("C",null,null,false);
         d = new BinaryTree("D",null,null,false);
         e = new BinaryTree("E",null,null,true);
         f = new BinaryTree("F",null,null,false);
         a = new BinaryTree("A",c,d,false);
         b = new BinaryTree("Root",a,b,false);
         return root;
        } 
          </pre>
    </div>
    <p style="color:grey">Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>
    <div style="border: solid grey">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
       public static void main(String args[]){
         BinaryTree tree = makeTree();
         System.out.println(solvable(tree));
       }
            </pre>
    </div>
    <p style="color:grey">And finally,here's the recursive Backtracking routing to "solve"the
        binary tree by finding a goal node.</p>
    <div style="border: solid grey	">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
      static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){
       /* 1 */ if (node == null)return false;<br>
       /* 2 */ if (node.isGoalNode)return true;<br>
       /* 3 */ if (solvable(node.leftChild))return ture;<br>
       /* 4 */ if (solvable(node.rightChild))return ture;<br>
       /* 5 */ return false;<br>
       }
              </pre>
    </div>
    <p style="color:grey"> Here's what the numbered lines are doing:</p>
    <ol start="1" style="color:grey; padding:1em;">
        <li>If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can
            call this method with the children of a node, without first checking whether those
            children actually exist.</li><br>
        <li>If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.</li><br>
        <li>See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable.
            We will only get to this line if node is non-null and is not a goal node, says to</li><br>
        <li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li><br>
        <li>Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable.</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="color:grey"> This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.</p>
    <p style="color:grey">Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that
        check as the first thing in solvable. An alternative would be to check first whether each child
        exists, and recur only if they do. Here's that alternative version:</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div style="border: solid grey">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
     static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){<br>
      if(node.isGoalNode)return ture;<br>
      if(node.leftChild!=null&&solvable(node.leftChild))return true;<br>
      if(node.roghtChild!=null&&solvable(node.rightChild))return true;<br>
      return false;<br>
     }
             </pre>
    </div>
    <p style="color:grey">I thinl the first version is simple,but the second is slightly more efficient.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>What are the children?</h3>
    <p style="color:grey">One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point,
        you can ignore all the previous choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about
        what you should do next; as far as you know, both the left and the right child are possible
        solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without
        recursion.</p>
    <p style="color:grey">Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that
        any map on a plane, no matter how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four
        colors, so that no two countries that share a border are the same color. </p>
    <p style="color:grey"> To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second
        country,
        and so on, until all countries are colored.</p>

    <p style="color:grey">There are two ways to do this:</p>
    <ul style=" padding:1em;">
        <li style="color:grey;">Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of
            countries,
            check whether you are at a goal node.</li><br>
        <li style="color:grey">Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country,
            and recur. If and when you run out of countries, you have successfully colored the map.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:grey">Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should
        be
        easily solvable; after all, a checkerboard only needs two colors.</p>

    <h3>boolean maplsOK()</h3>
    <p style="color:grey">Used by method 1 to check(st aleaf node)whether the entier map is colored currectly.</p>

    <h3>boolean okToColor(int row,int column,int color)</h3>
    <p style="color:grey">Used by method 2 to check, at every node,whether there is an adjacent
        node already colored with the given color.</p>

    <h3>int[]nextRowAndColumn(int row,int column)</h3>
    <p style="color:grey">Used by both method to ffind the next "country"(actually, the row and column of the next
        aquare on the checkboard).</p>
    <br>
    <p style="color:grey">Here's the code for method 1:</p>
    <div style="border: solid grey	">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        boolean explore1(int row,int column,int color){<br>
         if(row>=NUM_ROWS)returnmaplsOK();<br>
         map[row][column] = color;<br>
         for(int nextColor = RED;nextColor<=BLUE;nextColor++){<br>
            int[]next = nextRowAndColumn(row,column);<br>
            if(example1(next[0],next[1],nextColor))return true;<br>
          } <br>
          return false;
        }
               </pre>
    </div>
    <p style="color:grey">And here's the code for method 2:</p>
    <div style="border: solid grey	">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        boolean explore2(int row,int column,int color){<br>
          if(row>=NUM_ROWS)return true;<br>

    <p style="color:grey">The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond).
        Why this huge difference? Either of these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating
        a node automatically eliminates all of its descendents, and this will often prevent
        exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is reached, exponential
        growth is practically guaranteed. If there is any way to eliminate children (reduce the set
        of choices), do so!</p>

    <h3>Debugging Techniques</h3>
    <p style="color:grey">Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful,
        but sometimes we need to fall back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks
        to making effective use of print statements. These tricks can be applied to any program, but
        are especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.</p>
    <h3>Trick #1:Indent when you print method entries and exit.</h3>
    <p style="color:grey"> Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and return
        (or at least the most important ones). You probably want to print, for each method,
        what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just
        print a long list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with their corresponding
        entries. Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.

    </p>
    <h3>Trick #2:Use specialized print method for debugging.</h3>
    <p style="color:grey">Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember that code inserted for
        debugging purposes can itself contain bugs, or (in the worst case) can affect the results, so
        be very careful with it.</p>
    <p style="color:grey">Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than
        actual
        code, but in larger programs the proportions will be better.</p>
    <div style="border: solid grey">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        static String indent = "";<br><br>
        static String name (BinaryTree node){
         if(node == null)return null;
         else return node.name;
        } <br><br>
        static void enter(BinaryTree node){
         System.out.println(indent + "Entring solvable(" + name(node)")");
         indent=  indent + "|";
        } <br><br>
        static boolean yes(BinaryTree node){
         indent = indent.substring(3);
         System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ")return ture");
         return true;
        } <br><br>
        static boolean no(BinaryTree node){

        }
                 </pre>
    </div>
    <p style="color:grey">To use this code,we modify solvable as follows:</p>

    <div style="border: solid grey">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){<br>
         enter(node);<br>
         f (node == null)return no(node);<br>
         if (node.isGoalNode)return yes(node);<br>
         if (solvable(node.leftChild))return yes(node);<br>
         if (solvable(node.rightChild))return yes(node);<br>
         return no(node);<br>
       }
              </pre>
    </div>
    <p style="color:grey">And we get these results:</p>

    <h3>Trick#3:Never discard your debugging statements.</h3>
    <p style="color:grey">Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much work to debug the
        debugging statements as it is to debug the actual program. Once your program is working,
        why throw this code away?</p>
    <p style="color:grey">Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information from a program you are
        ready to submit (or to turn over to your manager). You could comment out your debugging calls,
        but that can be a lot of work. What's more, in the above example, you would have to replace
        every return(yes(node)) with return(true), and every return(no(node)) with return false. With
        all these changes, you might introduce new bugs into your program.</p>
    <p style="color:grey"> The simple solution is to make your debugging statements conditional. For example,</p>

    <div style="border: solid grey">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
                    static final boolean debugging = false;
                    <br>
                    
                    static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){<br>
                    if(debugging){
                      System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node)+")");
                      indent = indent + "| "; 
                    }
                  }

                  static boolean yes(Binary Tree node){

                    if(debugging){
                      indent = indent.substring(3);
                      System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true")
                    }
                    return true
                  }

                  static boolean no(BinaryTree node){
                    if(debugging){
                      indent = indent.substring(3);
                      System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns false");
                    }
                    return false;
                  }
                    
                      
         }
                </pre>
    </div>


    <p style="color:grey">In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control different aspects of
        debugging. Don't worry too much about making your code larger; modern compilers will notice
        that since the variable debugging is final, it can never be true, and the controlled code
        will be discarded.</p>
    <h3>Trick#4:Create an Exception.</h3>
    <p style="color:grey">If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by
        sending it the message printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object
        like any other, you can create and throw your own Exceptions. However, Java programmers
        don't always realize that you can create an Exception without throwing it. For example,
        the following code</p>
    <div style="border: solid grey">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
       new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);
                    </pre>
    </div>
    <p style="color:grey">will print out a message something like this, and the program will then continue normally.
        That is,
        the above code just acts like a print statement.</p>
    <div style="border: solid grey">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
      java.lang.Exception: Checkpoint Charlie 
          at TreeSearch.solvable(TreeSearch.java:53)

    <p style="color:grey">The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need
        to check whether we are at a leaf, which in this case means a position from which no further
        moves are possible. This isn't so easy. </p>
    <p style="color:grey">Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive
        backtracking
        routine to attempt to solve the puzzle. The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out
        a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to print out the bad news.</p>
    <p style="color:grey">The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to
        check whether
        we are at a leaf, which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't
        so easy.</p>
    <p style="color:grey">Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the
        children
        of the current board position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position),
        we need only find the possible moves from that node. Remember that it is also highly desirable to find
        an ordering on these possible moves.</p>
    <p style="color:grey"> Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some
        extent.
        Probably a number of approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out.
        If you were to program this puzzle, you might find a different but equally valid approach.</p>
    <p style="color:grey">First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one
        square, then it
        cannot jump. If it can jump, it cannot move ahead one square. This suggests that, to find the possible
        moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all
        the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require having a table to keep track of
        where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the board each
        time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive. </p>
    <p style="color:grey">Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. Hence,
        instead of
        talking about moving a particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space.
        If a move is possible from a given space, then that must be the only move possible from that space,
        because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a slight complication because not
        every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.
    </p>
    <p style="color:grey"><b style="color:black">Now we have a simpler ordering of moves to use in our program. Just
            check, in order, the 2n+1 spaces
            of the board. For each space, either zero or one moves is possible. With this understanding, we can
            write a boolean method canMove(int[] board, int position) which determines whether a move is possible
            from the given position:</b></p>
    <ul style="color:grey;padding:1em;">
        <li>If the position is empty, no move is possible;</li><br>
        <li>If the position contains a black marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the right;</li><br>
        <li>If the position contains a white marble, the method checks for a move or jump to the left.</li><br>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:grey">We write another method <b style="color:black">int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard,
            int position)</b> that will take a board and a position,
        make a move from that position, and return as its value a new board.
        (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board, rather than creating a new
        one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative"
        rather than "mutative."</p>
    <p style="color:grey">Along with <b style="color:black">canMove and makeMove,</b> we are using methods
        <b style="color:black">puzzleSolved and printBoard</b> with meanings that
        should be obvious. With these methods, our central backtracking method can be written as follows:
    </p>
    <div style="border: solid grey">
        <pre style="color: blue;">
        boolean solvable(int[] board){<br>
          if (puzzleSolved(board)){ 
              return true; 
          } 
          for (int position = 0; position < BOARD_SIZE; position++){
               if (canMove(board, position)){ 
                   int[] newBoard = makeMove(board, position); 
                   if (solvable(newBoard)){ 
                       printBoard(newBoard); 
                       return true;
                 }
              } 
            } 
            return false; 
        }                  
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p style="color:grey">Along with canMove and makeMove, we are using methods puzzleSolved and printBoard with
        meanings
        that should be obvious.</p>

            WHITE on the right, as in the last line. I've added line numbers to the actual output in
            order to emphasize this point. Backtracking always produces its results (sequence of choices)
            in reverse order; it is up to you, the programmer, to reverse the results again to get them in
            the correct order.</p>
